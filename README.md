# What's Not Included
Sound, good models, animation. I'm a programmer by nature, and I've not had a chance to develop my art focused skills. The scripts and documented and can easily have sound and animation implemented with the current structures.

Download the whole project and start making changes to your version. There is a main menu, level select, and a few levels for reference.
